## Overview
The Psychic game is a guessing game centered around the letters of the Alphabet.

## How Do I Win?
To win the Psychic Game, you must correctly guess the letter the computer is thinking of '10' times.

## How does the game work?
Each round, you will be given '10' guesses. If you guess the correct letter, you will win '1' point. 
If you fail to guess the letter correctly '10' times, you will lose '1' point.
'10' Losses in a row will result in an alert telling you that you lost the game.
'10' Wins in a row will result in an alert telling you that you won the game.
The computer will change the letter it is thinking after every entry by the user, so users are able to guess 
the same letter as much as they would like. 

## Developer Issues
As of this version, I have been unsuccesful in preventing the user from entering keys that are not the alphabet.
I have also struggled with making the computer stay with one letter per round. The game will be updated when these 
solutions are found.
